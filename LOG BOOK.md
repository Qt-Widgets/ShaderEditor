Downloaded _Qt creator_ to simplify the creation of GUI with Qt.
I have also searched for a simple node graph editor that I could use for my shader editor and I found _Qiwi_ which is a standalone and very light and easy to understand piece of code to create node graphs.

Goals for tomorrow:
-Modify the code of _Qiwi_ so that I can integrate an _OpenGL_ textures viewer in each node
-Try to integrate a simple text editor in each node
-Try to make the nodes expand on click so that the user can easily see the whole node hierarchy on his screen
